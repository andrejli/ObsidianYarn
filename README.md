# ObsidianYarn
Generator Obsidian Markdown files from and to files

Takes data from 'plan.txt' and generates md. files in your Obsidian Vault
Data are stored as into ROWS
Each Rows starts with NAME of note [[Duplicit Notes are Possible]]
... continous with name of links

In future will be a support for templates. Now you can edit template only in SOURCE.

Files will be generated without CONTENT except NAME and Links
Already created files are not OVERWRITTEN by Script.

Happy Hacking :)
